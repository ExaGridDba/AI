Munge this sql statement to a 27-character lower case string without spaces or punctuation.
The munge should be loosely based on the table name, the predicate, and the critical output columns.

select u.username, u.account_status, u.expiry_date, u.profile from dba_users u where u.username = :username.

Return only the 27-character string.
Return only one word.
No other chit-chat.
Don't say "Okay, here's the munge"
Only return the one-word munge.
